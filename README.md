# Installing Dependencies
This site uses Node Package Manger (npm). You need to install Node.js before you can use it. [Get it here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

1. Once it is downloaded and installed open up your comand prompt and navigate into the directory you cloned the project into.
2. run `npm install`
3. You will probably have to install gulp and gulp-cli so run `npm install -g gulp gulp-cli`
4. Assuming everything installed fine you can now run the command `gulp`

Gulp is the tool that runs our sass compile and any other process we want it to run. You can learn more about gulp [here](https://gulpjs.com/)
